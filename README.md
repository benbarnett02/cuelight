# cuelight
### A basic system for theatrical cue lights
Cue light system running on the ATmega328P (intended for Arduino uno) for use in theatrical/live events. Very much a work in progress, however intended for future production.
Original system idea by Matt Hudson

Part of this project is also learning how to use Git & GitHub.
